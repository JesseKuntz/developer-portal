For ASAs, compared to ERC20, the process differs due to the fact that the tokens details are hardcoded within the Algorand Nano application instead of being streamed to the device. Furthermore, the ownership of the Algorand Nano Application source code lies with the Algorand team. Request for updates must be validated by them before being reviewed by Ledger.

## How to request a token addition

### 1. Is my ASA token listed ?

First, make sure your token isnâ€™t already listed by checking this table of the [supported crypto-assets](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-desktop/blob/develop/cryptoassets.md).

### 2. How to get my token listed ?

Update the [Algorand Nano app](https://github.com/algorand/ledger-app-algorand/blob/master/src/algo_asa.c). 
When your PR is validated by the Algorand team, they will make a PR to Ledger Github repository.

Then, you need to update the [ledgerjs package](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/blob/master/packages/cryptoassets/data/asa.js).
