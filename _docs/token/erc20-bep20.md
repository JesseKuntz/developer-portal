## How to request a token addition

### 1. Is my ERC20, BEP20 or Polygon token listed?

First, make sure your token isn’t already listed by checking this table of the [supported crypto-assets](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/apps/ledger-live-desktop/cryptoassets.md).

Please note you can easily change the tag version to check the content of a specific Ledger Live version.

For the moment it’s difficult to guarantee the exact mapping between tokens available on Ledger Live and listed on the website." %}

### 2. How to get my token listed?

Fill in this form:

<div data-tf-widget="Miekq8b2" style="width:100%;height:400px;"></div><script src="//embed.typeform.com/next/embed.js"></script>

### What next?

This is all you need to do. We will review the list of tokens on a bi-montly basis and will apply our own internal signature process. Once signed, the new tokens will become available after a Ledger Live update. Ledger reserves the right to decide which token will be listed.
