## How to request a token addition

### 1. Is my ERC20 token listed ?

First, make sure your token isnâ€™t already listed by checking the [repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/tree/master/packages/cryptoassets/data).

### 2. How to get my token listed ?

Then, fill in [this form](https://developers.ledger.com/contact/). Please make sure to share with us the details of your ERC20 token, and a link to Etherscan to allow us to double check the information.

### 3. How do I add my token icon ?

Ledger Live relies on [this repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/tree/master/src/data/icons/svg) to manage coins and tokens icons. Please make a PR to the [repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/tree/master/src/data/icons/svg) to get your token icon visible on Ledger Live.

### What will Ledger do ?

We will review the list of tokens on a bi-montly basis and will apply our own internal signature process. Once signed, the new tokens will become available after a Ledger Live update. Ledger reserves the right to decide which token will be listed.
