## Introduction

- Intro written by Noe (in lieu of FAQ) (TBD)
- How it is different to the other integrations here (TBD by us)


Ledger Connect allows you to use any Web3 Apps with your Ledger Nano X to prevent hacks, scams, and keep your crypto and NFTs secure.

This version supports Safari on iOS only. It is released as a Safari Web Extension, but will be shipped together with the Ledger Live mobile app in the future. Weâ€™re currently in beta, via the Apple TestFlight app.

### Video (TBD)

## Prerequisites
