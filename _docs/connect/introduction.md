## Introduction

Ledger Connect allows you to use any Web3 App with your Ledger Nano X to prevent hacks, scams, and keep your crypto and NFTs secure.

This version supports Safari on iOS only. It is released as a Safari Web Extension, but will be shipped together with the Ledger Live mobile app in the future. Weâ€™re currently in beta, via the Apple TestFlight app.

In this documentation you will find some basic information to get your coding started. Keep in mind that this product is currently at a very early stage, and that more thorough guidelines will come in the future.
