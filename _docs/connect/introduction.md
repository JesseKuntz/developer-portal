## Introduction

Ledger Connect allows you to use any Web3 Apps with your Ledger Nano X to prevent hacks, scams, and keep your crypto and NFTs secure.

This version supports Safari on iOS only. It is released as a Safari Web Extension, but will be shipped together with the Ledger Live mobile app in the future. Weâ€™re currently in beta, via the Apple TestFlight app.

### Video (TBD)

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisites concern the Blockchains & Networks which are currently supported:

- Ethereum (EIP-712, EIP-191, and EIP-1193)
- Solana

More platforms and blockchains to come at a later date.


## Summary of actions

1. Join our Discord server and the Ledger-connect-extension channel where you will contact us to get the extension 
2. Implement the API calls in your DApp
3. Web3Checks (optional): Add your DApp to the whitelist using the form.
4. Add the Ledger logo to your DApp
5. Testing (TBD)
6. Go to Discord and agree on an announcement on socials
