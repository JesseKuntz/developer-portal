## Ready to submit your App for review?

Once you have finished your work and you have collected all the App items (see [checklist](../deliverables-checklist)), you must enter them in the [form](https://ledger.typeform.com/to/ZFVKrEHN).

Make sure you thoroughly complete the form to ensure a speedy release process.

This is the end of your process.  
From here on, all communications will take place on Discord.  
Thank you.  

Looking forward to seeing your App in the Ledger Live Manager!
