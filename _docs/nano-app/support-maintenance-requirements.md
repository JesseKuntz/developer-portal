## Support

Ledger does not provide support for third party applications. 

Please provide information that will allow the Ledger support team to redirect users to relevant support resources:
- Identity: Name, Surname, Legal Entity
- Point of Contact: URL, email address, phone number

If you use community channels for support, you must ensure that it is moderated.

## Maintenance

After your application  release, every change made must go through a new security audit and a functional review before being released.
To have your application updates released on time, we advise you to inform Ledgerâ€™s team as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.
