## Support

Ledger does not provide support for third party applications. Third party teams must host a complete tutorial to guide users before the app is released on the Ledger Live Manager. Please follow the [documentation-requirements](../documentation-requirements)

Along with your tutorial, please provide information that will allow the Ledger support team to redirect users to relevant support resources:
- Point of Contact: URL, email address, phone number

If you use community channels for support, you must ensure that it is moderated.

## Maintenance

After your application  release, every change made must go through a new security audit and a functional review before being released.
To have your application updates released on time, we advise you to inform Ledgerâ€™s team as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.
