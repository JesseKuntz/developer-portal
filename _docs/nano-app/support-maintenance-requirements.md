## Support

Ledger does not provide support for third party applications. It is required for third party teams to provide and host a complete tutorial that will guide users before the app is released on the Ledger Manager (please follow these guidelines).

Along with your publication request, app sources and tutorial, please provide information that will allow the Ledger support team to redirect users to relevant support resources:
- Identity: Name, Surname, Legal Entity
- Point of Contact: URL, email address, phone number

If you use community channels for support, you must ensure that it is moderated.

## Maintenance

After your application  release, every change made must go through a new security audit and a functional review before being released.
To have your application updates released on time, we advise you to inform Ledgerâ€™s team as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.
