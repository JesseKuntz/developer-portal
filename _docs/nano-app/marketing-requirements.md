| Device giveway<br>[Blog post/Press Release](#blog-post-press-release)<br><b>Optional</b> | Quote from Ledger<br><b>If Blockchain is in top 50 CMC |

## Twitter announcement

A Twitter announcement is the minimal communication requirement.

It must include the following:
- A message about the secure storage of assets
- An link to Ledger hardware wallet. You can use an affiliate link or a regular link. [Our affiliate program](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/affiliates) allows you to earn 10% of each hardware sale in Bitcoin or Fiat. 

## Blog post / Press Release

If the Blockchain is in top 50 CMC, the blog post can include a quote from the CEO, CTO, a Founder, or another c-level executive regarding the collaboration and the impact it will have on your project.
