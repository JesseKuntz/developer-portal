## What is a variant application ?

A variant, or clone, Nano Applications is developed when all the logic for signing transaction can be contained in the Bitcoin or the Ethereum Nano Application.

The variant application is accessible in the Ledger Live Manager and requires the installation of its parent app. On opening, the user is immidiatly redirected to the parent app.

Just as for an independant Nano Application, you must follow our guidelines to comply Ledger's publication requirements.

## What is the process ?

### Developing the application

Instead of building your application in a separate repository, you will make changes to the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum) or [Bitcoin app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin).
Click here for [Ethereum variants](../eth-variants) and here for [Bitcoin variants](btc-variants).

### Building the application

To build and load the application to a Nano S, [follow these guidelines]().

### Publishing the application

If you want to publish a variant application, follow the process in [Publishing an application](../publish-introduction).
