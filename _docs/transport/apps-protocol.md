## Low Level implementation

As soon as your <i>Transport</i> is created, you can already communicate by implementing the apps protocol (refer to the application documentations, for instance [BTC app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/doc/btc.asc) and [ETH app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-eth/blob/master/doc/ethapp.asc)).


## High Level implementation

We provide libraries that help implementing the low level exchanges. These higher level APIs are split per app:

- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth](./packages/hw-app-eth): Ethereum Application API
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc](./packages/hw-app-btc): Bitcoin Application API
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp](./packages/hw-app-xrp): Ripple Application API
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-str.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-str) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-str](./packages/hw-app-str): Stellar Application API

On each crypto asset projects' GitHub you can find libraries that will help you implementing the exchanges, for example this [Cardano JS library](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano).
We invite you to to check if this kind of librairies have been developed for the crypto asset you would like to integrate to your wallet app.
