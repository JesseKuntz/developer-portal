## Low Level implementation

As soon as your <i>Transport</i> is created, you can already communicate by implementing the apps protocol.
The ways to implement a Nano App protocol will vary, depending on the way the community developed their Nano app. We recommend you to refer to the application documentations, for instance [BTC app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/doc/btc.asc) and [ETH app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-eth/blob/master/doc/ethapp.asc).

Some communities have developed JS packages for a higher level implementation.


## High Level implementation

We provide libraries that help implementing the low level exchanges. These higher level APIs are split per app:

- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth](./packages/hw-app-eth): Ethereum Application API
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc](./packages/hw-app-btc): Bitcoin Application API
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp](./packages/hw-app-xrp): Ripple Application API
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ledgerhq/hw-app-str.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-str) [@ledgerhq/hw-app-str](./packages/hw-app-str): Stellar Application API

On each crypto asset projects' GitHub you can find libraries that will help you implementing the exchanges, for example this [Cardano JS library](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano).
We invite you to to check if this kind of librairies have been developed for the crypto asset you would like to integrate to your wallet app.

## How to know if a Nano application allows a type of transport?

In a Nano Application, each mode of transport is declared in the Makefile. For a wallet app to communicate with a Nano App through a device, the same mode of transport must be implemented on each side.

You can check the Makefile of a targeted Nano App to find this information. For example, the Bitcoin App enables WebUSB transport and it is declared at the [277th line of the Makefile](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin/blob/75dfa48faa6c34d96d2aeb7a7994024e895148a9/Makefile#L227).
