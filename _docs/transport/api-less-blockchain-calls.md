## Code from scratch...

The ways to implement a Nano App protocol will vary, depending on the way the community developed their Nano app.

To implement the connexion and communication from scratch, we recommend you to refer to the application documentations, for instance [BTC app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/doc/btc.asc) and [ETH app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-eth/blob/master/doc/ethapp.asc).
