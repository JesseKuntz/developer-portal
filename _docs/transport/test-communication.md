## How to know if a Nano application allows a type of transport?

In a Nano Application, each mode of transport is declared in the Makefile. For a wallet app to communicate with a Nano App through a device, the same mode of transport must be implemented on each side.

You can check the Makefile of a targeted Nano App to find this information. For example, the Bitcoin App enables WebUSB transport and it is declared at the [277th line of the Makefile](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin/blob/75dfa48faa6c34d96d2aeb7a7994024e895148a9/Makefile#L227).

`DEFINES   += HAVE_WEBUSB WEBUSB_URL_SIZE_B=0 WEBUSB_URL=""`


## Test the communication with Ledger REPL

The [Ledger REPL](https://repl.ledger.tools/) web application is a Nano terminal to exchange binary messages with the device. It has a set of different communication channels (transports), and so it is useful to test webusb and even web bluetooth for Nano X.

For example, if you just want to verify communication is properly established with a Nano App:

1. Chose your transport in the dropdown menu
2. Plug your Ledger Nano S or X
3. Send a basic ADPU (for example `B001000000` which gives you the App's name and version)

If you get a response, this means the connexion and communication work.
