## Live App setup tutorial

In this tutorial, you will create a simple Live App using the [live-app-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/live-app-sdk) and test it locally in your Ledger Live application.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript.

You will need at least:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS version (>= 14.17.3)
- A package manager. In this tutorial we will use `yarn` (>= 1.22.10) but it will also work with `npm` (>= 6.14.13)
- A [Ledger Nano S, X or S Plus](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison) to access Ledger Live. 


Even though [React](https://reactjs.org/) is used for the boilerplate app of the tutorial, knowing React is not a prerequisite.
