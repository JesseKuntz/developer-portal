## Prerequisites

 Before testing your app, make sure you have completed the following requirements:
 - Download and install [Ledger Live Desktop](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download).
 - Enable Ledger Live [Developer Mode](../../../developer-mode).
 - Write your [Manifest file](../../manifest).

## Test your Platform App in Ledger Live

In the Ledger Live developer tab, enable the option **Enable Platform dev tools**. It will allow you to use a browser-like developer tools window to inspect your application.

Then click on **Browse** next to **Add a local app** and import your application's [Manifest file](../../reference/manifest).

Your application appears in a new row below. 

Click **Open** to open your application inside Ledger Live.

You are now able to locally and autonomously test your application integration inside Ledger Live.

You can refer to the [Tutorial](../../tutorial/4-test) for more details.
