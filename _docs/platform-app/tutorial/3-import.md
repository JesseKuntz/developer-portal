To import the manifest:

2. Enable the Developer mode

## Enabling the Developer mode

To enable the Developer mode, go to the **Settings** -> **About** section, and click 10 times on the Ledger Live version. A new **Developer** section appears in the settings menu.

Make sure to turn on **Enable platform dev tools**, as it will allow you to open a browser-like developer tools window to inspect your app.

Now that you have added your Live App in your local Ledger Live application, it’s time to open it and test it. We’ll see this in the next section.
