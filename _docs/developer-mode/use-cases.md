## I am transforming my DApp or non-DApp into a Live App

When you want to test locally how your [Live App](../docs/live-app) works in Ledger Live, you will need to unlock the developer mode to import your app's manifest. 

## I am developing a Nano App

Before an official release, your Nano App can be release in "Developer mode". When you activate the developer mode setting you will be able to see how your app works in Ledger Live.
