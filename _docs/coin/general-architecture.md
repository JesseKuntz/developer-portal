## Global architecture overview

<!-- --------------------------------- -->

- The hardware wallet acts as a signing box and it defers most of the technical complexity to a **wallet application** (Ledger Live or a third-party wallet). The wallet application contains the business logic and is (typically) a GUI, running on a computer or a phone connected to the hardware wallet.
- The Nano application acts as a transaction signer key in a deterministic way. Having a publicly listed Nano application is a mandatory requirement before getting your blockchain supported on Ledger Live.
- In the case of Ledger Live, and for performance reason, a third layer is handling the indexing of transaction for a given blockchain.

## Ledger Live Architecture Detailed

Ledger Live is Ledger's official wallet application for Desktop and Mobile, providing a unique interface to maintain multiple cryptocurrencies for Ledger Nano S and X, manage devices, create accounts, receive and send cryptoassets. It communicates with  hardware wallet devices to verify addresses and sign transactions with ledgerjs.

Ledger Live Desktop is an hybrid application built using Electron, React Native, React, Redux, RxJS. It is compatible with **macOS 10.10+**, **Windows 8+ (x64)** and **Linux (x64)**. The Ledger Live mobile app is compatible with **iOS** and **Android**.

The Ledger Live application act as a relay between the different blockchains, and the hardware wallets.


### Communication with the Device

[ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs) is a set of JavaScript library. It allows a javascript
application to use the API of a Nano app. Nano apps are using APDU to
transfer data and commands to and from the external world. `ledgerjs` only
allows to use commands developed on the Nano app.


### Communication with the different blockchains

The Ledger Live application wil retrieve transaction history and broadcast new transactions using different explorers.

As part of a Ledger Live coin integration, you should provide a indexer allowing a Ledger Live user to synchronize his account in a timely manner. It can be an open source project or your own explorer.

The Ledger Live application uses our own explorer for Bitcoin and Ethereum forks.


### Live-Common

The Common library of Ledger Live is called [Ledger-live-common](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common). It provides a single library compatible with both desktop and mobile version of Ledger Live.

### Process

To integrate your coin to Ledger Live you will need to:
- Have a Nano Application (see [how to develop your Nano App](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/introduction/))
- Provide an indexer (see the [prerequisites](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/coin/prerequisites/))
- Add your coin to [ledgerjs](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/coin/js-bindings/)
- Add your coin to [the Cryptoassets library](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/coin/cryptoassets-library/)
- Add your coin to [live-common](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/coin/live-common/)
- Add your coin to [Ledger Live desktop and mobile](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/coin/desktop-mobile/)
