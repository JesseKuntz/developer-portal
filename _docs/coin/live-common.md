## Introduction

Ledger Live Common is the shared core library used by Ledger Live Desktop and Mobile, that also includes a CLI for testing purpose or for using Ledger Live features directly from a terminal (in a limited way).

This library is built upon a pretty standard ES6 + Typescript stack and relies on a bunch of [ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs) packages, [RxJS 6.x](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/tree/6.x), [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) + [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) for some front-end utilities and hooks.

It is designed to have very generic models and mechanics (for currencies, accounts, storage, synchronisation, events...) that also facilitates new blockchain integrations through flexibility.
All integrated coins are implemented in a `src/families` dedicated folder which contains the specifics of a coin family - that can be shared by multiple crypto-assets that use the same implementation (i.e. Bitcoin-like coins share the same `bitcoin` family).

**This document only concerns new blockchain integrations using Typescript - we will use an imaginary coin named `MyCoin` as a walkthrough.**

## Setup

### Requirements

- [NodeJS LTS/Fermium (Node 14.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) 1.x (Classic)
- Python 2.7 or 3.5+
- A C/C++ toolchain (see node-gyp documentation)

### Development tools (used or required)

- [yalc](../yalc) for locally linking ledger-live-common with other projects
- [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) - ensure it's working in your IDE ([vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint))
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - through an eslint-plugin
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - ensure it works fine with your IDE

### Hardware prerequisites

- A physical device (Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X)
- <i>MyCoin</i> app installed on device

### Installation

- Clone project [https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common)
- `yarn install` will install all dependencies
- `yalc publish --push` will build and link ledger-live-common

## Structure

Your whole implementation of <i>MyCoin</i> must reside in a `mycoin` folder in `src/families/`, with the exception of some changes to apply in shared code.

Here is a typical family folder structure (TS integration):

```plaintext
./src/families/mycoin
├── bridge
│   └── js.ts
├── hw-app-mycoin
│   └── MyCoin.ts
├── api.ts
├── hw-getAddress.ts
├── errors.ts
├── deviceTransactionConfig.ts
├── account.ts
├── transaction.ts
├── serialization.ts
├── cli-transaction.ts
├── logic.ts
├── cache.ts
├── preload.ts
├── react.ts
├── specs.ts
├── speculos-deviceActions.ts
├── test-dataset.ts
├── test-specifics.ts
└── types.ts
```

<!--  -->



## Generating families-specific imports

All per-family imports are gathered in the [`src/generated`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/tree/master/src/generated) folder, for letting generic code to choose which implementation to use on a per-coin basis.

You should not update those files manually, but call a dedicated script:

```sh
./scripts/sync-families-dispatch.sh
```

{% include alert.html style="tip" text="you may need to add <code>mycoin</code> to the <code>withoutNetworkInfo</code> in this script if you don't use a NetworkInfo type." %}


**As soon as you add a file in the family (that is part of the generated folder) you will need to execute this script before building.** Otherwise, your implementation will not be known by the ledger-live-common library.

## Building for Development

Do not forget to build before testing:

```sh
yalc publish --push
# if not yarn watch
cd cli
yarn build
```

### Environment Variables

Ledger Live provides a lot of flexibility through ENV variables. You can export them, define them before calling cli or use a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

To list them all, you can execute:

```sh
ledger-live envs
```

The one you will use the most before releasing you integration is:

```sh
EXPERIMENTAL_CURRENCIES=mycoin
```

to use them : 
```sh
EXPERIMENTAL_CURRENCIES=mycoin ledger-live send -c mycoin --amount 0.1 ---recipient mycoinaddr -i 0
```

or for LLD :
```sh
EXPERIMENTAL_CURRENCIES=mycoin yarn start
```

It will consider `mycoin` as supported (you can also add it to the supported currencies in `cli/src/ledger-live-common-setup-base.ts`).

**For clarity, we will omit this environment variable in this document.**

If needed, you can add your own in `src/env.ts` (always try to add a MYCOIN\_ prefix to avoid collisions):

```ts
// const envDefinitions = { ...
  MYCOIN_API_ENDPOINT: {
    def: "https://mycoin.coin.ledger.com",
    parser: stringParser,
    desc: "API for mycoin",
  },
// }
```
