Speculos is the emulator of Ledger hardware wallets (Nano S, Nano X, Nano S Plus and Blue) on desktop computers. It is particularly useful when  
- you don't have the physical hardware device, or 
- you want to facilitate the pressing of Nano buttons.

If you want to go through the entire Speculos documentation, [click here](../../speculos/introduction).

You will need Speculos to test your Blockchain integration.
