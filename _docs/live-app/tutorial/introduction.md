## Live App setup tutorial

In this tutorial, you will create a simple Live App using the [live-app-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/live-app-sdk) and test it locally inside your Ledger Live application.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript.

You will need at least:
- a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS version (`>= 14.17.3`)
- a package manager. This tuto will use `yarn` (`>= 1.22.10`) but it might also work with `npm` (`>= 6.14.13`)
- a [Ledger Device](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison) (Nano S or X). You will need one to access Ledger Live. 


Even though this tutorial will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the boilerplate app, it's not a prerequisite for this tutorial.
