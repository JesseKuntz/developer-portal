The main phases to get your Live App officially released are:

- **Development** which includes implementing the DApp on your server and the Nano application plugin for DApps, implementing the SDK for a classical application, and writing the Live App manifest. 
 
- **Agreement** between you and Ledger regarding the Terms & Conditions, and validation of the integration by Ledger. The Agreement can be finalised during the development phase, as there may already be a common understanding.
  If you want to know more, or if you simply want get in touch then reach out to Ledger on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ledger).

- **Review and acceptance** is about Ledger reviewing your proposed changes and accepting them. Your support will most likely be required along the way. Please note [the manifest file](../manifest) will be required when submitting your Live App to Ledger for review and official release.
