Many applications such as Paraswap, Moonpay or Lido, have been integrated in the Discover section of the Ledger Live application. This allows our users to have easier access to different services but also discover new ways to handle their crypto-assets. 

In this section you will find the information about how to transform your Dapp or classical application into a Live App.

### Development steps

Whether you're integrating a DApp or another type of application, you will need to know if you have to:

| Type of App     |  [Use the SDK](../intro-sdk)   | [Write a manifest](../manifest) | [Adapt web3 provider list](../dapp-customisation)     | [Create a Nano Plugin](../nano-app-plugin) | 
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | 
| <b>DApp</b>	  | No             | Yes		      | Yes 						 | Yes                  |
| <b>Other</b>	  | Yes            | Yes              | No                           | <a href="#im-integrating-a-centralized-app-do-i-need-a-nano-plugin">It depends</a>         |


#### I'm integrating a centralized app, do I need a Nano Plugin?

It will depend on what your application allows the user to do and how it will interact with the Nano and blockchain. For more information get in touch with us [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ledger).
