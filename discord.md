#### The first time you connect to our server

Please read the server guide to learn about the server rules and information about the roles on the server. You will then get verified buy clicking the requested emoji on the verification channel.


#### After verification

You will have access to **welcome channels**, **dev lounge channels**, **dev support channels** and the **update** category.

Please make sure you've introduced yourself in the **#introductions** channel.

You can also visit the **#assign-a-role** channel to gain additional features on the server. These additional features can be notifications for a specific type of event, access to private channels, or customization of your profile on the server.

#### Private channels

Additionnaly to the public support channels, your team will have access to a private channel to get assisted through your integration process.
